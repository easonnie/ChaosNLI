## Papers
[What Can We Learn from Collective Human Opinions on Natural Language Inference Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03532)

[Distributed NLI: Learning to Predict Human Opinion Distributions for Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08676)

## Motivation
Most NLU evaluations have focused on using the **majority label** with presumably high agreement as the ground truth. Less attention has been paid to the **distribution of human opinions**.  
We believe that we should consider to take a step back and look at **collective human opinions** on NLP tasks.  

![everything is an opinion](https://github.com/easonnie/ChaosNLI/blob/master/img/opinion.jpg)

## Examples
**Chaos NLI** is a dataset with 100 annotations per example (a total of 4,645 * 100 annotations) for some existing data points in the development set of [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/), [MNLI](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/), and [Abductive NLI](http://abductivecommonsense.xyz/).  
Common practice for model evaluation, use the majority labels in the original dataset as the one gold labels and calculate model accuracy based on that.  
A more fine-grained evaluation should consider comparing **model distribution outputs** with the **human label distributions**.  

### NLI Example
Is the hypothesis entailed or contradicted (or neither) by the premise?  

Premise | Hypothesis | New Annotations | Old Annotations | BERT-Large Prediction
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
There are a number of expensive jewelry and other duty-free shops, all with goods priced in US dollars (duty-free goods must always be paid for in foreign currency).|You can pay using the US dollar when buying goods from the duty-free shops.|E(51), N(3), C(46)|C, C, E, N, C|E(50.03%), N(5.33%), C(44.63%)
This number represents the most reliable, albeit conservative, estimate of cases closed in 1999 by LSC grantees.|This is an actual verified number of closed cases.|E(21), N(12), C(67)|C, E, C, E, E|E(15.72%), N(14.04%), C(70.24%)

### Abductive NLI Example
Which of the two hypotheses is more likely to cause Observation-Beginning to turn into Observation-Ending?  

Observation Start | Hypothesis 1 | Hypothesis 2 | Observation End | New Annotation | Old Annotation | BERT-Large Prediction
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Ruth was playing video games.|Ruth started playing a new game.|Ruth challenged her friend to a game of golf.|She won the game easily.|1(58), 2(42)|1|1(99.99%), 2(0.01%)
Gina entered her classroom and went to her desk.|Tami had asked Gina not to talk with the gossip girls.|She started talking to some friends, but a bully named Tami butted in.|The fact that Tami was still talking to them made Gina uncomfortable.|1(50), 2(50)|2|1(0.01%), 2(99.99%)
Amy and her friends were out at 3 AM.|They started getting followed by a policeman, ran, and hid behind a building.|The decided to break into the football field. When suddenly they saw a flashlight comming towards them. They all started running for the bleachers.|They stayed there breathing hard, and praying they hadn't been seen.|1(50), 2(50)|2|1(57.53%), 2(32.47%)

If you want your results to be showed on the Scoreboard, please email us (<yixin1@cs.unc.edu> or <nyixin318@gmail.com>) with **the name of the entry**, **a link to your method**, and **your model prediction file** (please follow the [instruction](https://github.com/easonnie/ChaosNLI#how-can-i-evaluate-my-own-results) to build and test your prediction file).

## Data and Format
### Where can I download the data？
**ChaosNLI** is available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/h4j7dqszmpt2679/chaosNLI_v1.0.zip.  

Alternatively, you can download the data with the following script:
```bash
# make sure you are at the root of chaos_nli directory
source setup.sh     # setup path
bash scripts/download_data.sh
```
The script will not only download the ChaosNLI data and but also the predictions of model in the `chaos_nli/data`.  

If you want to use the scripts in this repository to reproduce the results, please make sure the data is downloaded in the correct path.

### What is the format?
#### Data Format
**ChaosNLI** is in `JSONL`. Every line in the file is one single JavaScript Object and can be easily loaded in python dictionary.  
The fields of the objects are self-explanatory. Please see the following sample to learn the details about the field.
```JS
// ChaosNLI-(S+M)NLI  'chaosNLI_mnli_m.jsonl' and 'chaosNLI_snli.jsonl'

{   "uid": "46359n",                                // The unique id of this example. This is the same id as the one in SNLI/MNLI pairID field and can be used to map back to the SNLI/MNLI data.                            
    "label_counter": {"e": 76, "n": 20, "c": 4},    // The dictionary indicates the count of each newly collected ChaosNLI label. e=entailment; n=neutral; c=contradiction.
    "majority_label": "e",                          // The majority label of the new ChaosNLI labels. (This might be different from the old label.)
    "label_dist": [0.76, 0.2, 0.04],                // The label distributions. (The order matters and should always be: [E, N, C])
    "label_count": [76, 20, 4],                     // The label counts. (The order matters and should always be: [E, N, C])
    "entropy": 0.9510456605801273,                  // The entropy of the label distriction. (base is 2)
    "example": {
        "uid": "46359n", 
        "premise": "Although all four categories of emissions are down substantially, they only achieve 50-75% of the proposed cap by 2007 (shown as the dotted horizontal line in each of the above figures).", 
        "hypothesis": "The downturn in the emission categories simply isn't enough in our estimation.", 
        "source": "mnli_agree_3"
    }, 
    "old_label": "n",                                                               // The old majority (gold) label.
    "old_labels": ["neutral", "entailment", "neutral", "neutral", "contradiction"]  // The old individual annotations.
}
```

```JS
// ChaosNLI-alphaNLI 'chaosNLI_alphanli.jsonl'
{   "uid": "a05ed03f-9713-4272-9cc0-c20b823bf5e4-1",    // The unique id of this example. This is the same id as the one in alaphanli story_id field and can be used to map back to the alaphanli data.
    "label_counter": {"2": 9, "1": 91},                 // The dictionary indicates the count of each newly collected ChaosNLI label.
    "majority_label": 1,                                // The majority label of the new ChaosNLI labels. (This might be different from the old label.)
    "label_dist": [0.91, 0.09],                         // The label distributions. (The order matters and should always be: [1, 2])

}
```

#### Model Prediction Format
We also provide the predictions of BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, BART, ALBERT, DistilBERT on SNLI, MNLI, and alphaNLI. The data can also be found in `data/model_predictions`.

To examine **the factor of human agreement on model performance**, check out this informative [jupyter-notebook](https://github.com/easonnie/ChaosNLI/blob/master/src/notebook/binned_plot.ipynb) to find the partitioned results according to the entropy range. 

### Improving Distribution Estimation
In the [distnli](https://github.com/easonnie/ChaosNLI/tree/master/distnli) folder, we provide implementation of several methods (e.g. Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensemble, Re-Calibration, etc.) used in the Distributed NLI paper that can improve the distribution estimation performance upon the vanilla BERT-style baseline. Please see the README under that folder for detailed instructions.

## Evaluate
### How can I evaluate my own results?
Build your prediction file according to the sample file in `data/prediction_samples`.  
**Tip: You will need to popularize both the "`predicted_probabilities`" and "`predicted_label`" fields.**

Then, you can evaluate your method with the following script:
```
# For MNLI:
python src/scripts/evaluate.py \
    --task_name uncertainty_nli \ 
    --data_file [path_of_chaos_nli_repo]/chaos_nli/data/chaosNLI_v1.0/chaosNLI_mnli_m.jsonl \
    --prediction_file [path_of_chaos_nli_repo]/chaos_nli/data/prediction_samples/mnli_random_baseline.json

# For SNLI:
python src/scripts/evaluate.py \
    --task_name uncertainty_nli \
    --data_file [path_of_chaos_nli_repo]/chaos_nli/data/chaosNLI_v1.0/chaosNLI_snli.jsonl \
    --prediction_file [path_of_chaos_nli_repo]/chaos_nli/data/prediction_samples/snli_random_baseline.json

# For alphaNLI:
python src/scripts/evaluate.py \
    --task_name uncertainty_abdnli
    --data_file [path_of_chaos_nli_repo]/chaos_nli/data/chaosNLI_v1.0/chaosNLI_alphanli.jsonl
    --prediction_file [path_of_chaos_nli_repo]/chaos_nli/data/prediction_samples/abdnli_random_baseline.json
```
